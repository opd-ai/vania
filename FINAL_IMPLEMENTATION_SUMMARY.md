## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Automatic)
```go
// Enemies automatically get advanced AI
enemy := NewEnemyInstance(enemyDef, x, y)

// Update activates all AI systems
enemy.Update(playerX, playerY)

// Combat events automatically recorded
enemy.TakeDamage(damage)
enemy.RecordSuccessfulHit(distance)
```

### Group Coordination
```go
// Create group for room enemies
group := NewEnemyGroup()
for _, enemy := range roomEnemies {
    group.AddMember(enemy)
    enemy.Group = group
}

// Update coordinates the group
group.UpdateGroup(playerX, playerY)
// Enemies now use formations and coordinate attacks
```

### Querying AI State
```go
// Debug or adjust gameplay based on AI state
fmt.Printf("Tactical State: %v\n", enemy.TacticalState)
fmt.Printf("Player Skill: %.2f\n", enemy.Memory.PlayerSkillEstimate)
fmt.Printf("Successful Hits: %d\n", enemy.Memory.SuccessfulHits)

if enemy.TacticalState == TacticalRetreating {
    // Enemy is fleeing - pursue or let escape
}
```
