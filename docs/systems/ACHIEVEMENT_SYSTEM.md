## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
internal/achievement/
├── achievement.go      - Core achievement tracking system
├── achievement_test.go - Comprehensive unit tests (32 tests)
├── persistence.go      - Save/load functionality
└── persistence_test.go - Persistence tests
```

### Core Components

#### AchievementTracker

The main class that manages all achievement tracking:

```go
type AchievementTracker struct {
    achievements map[AchievementID]*Achievement
    unlocked     map[AchievementID]*UnlockedAchievement
    progress     map[AchievementID]*AchievementProgress
    stats        Statistics
    onUnlock     func(achievement *Achievement)
}
```

#### Statistics

Tracks all player statistics for achievement calculations:

```go
type Statistics struct {
    // Combat
    EnemiesDefeated    int
    BossesDefeated     int
    TotalDamageDealt   int
    DamageTaken        int
    PerfectKills       int
    
    // Exploration
    RoomsVisited       int
    BiomesExplored     int
    SecretsFound       int
    
    // Collection
    ItemsCollected     int
    AbilitiesUnlocked  int
    
    // Speed/Time
    StartTime          time.Time
    PlayTime           int64
    FastestBossKill    int64
    
    // Special
    DeathCount         int
    PerfectRooms       int
    ConsecutiveKills   int
    LongestCombo       int
}
```

### Integration Points

The achievement system integrates with the game engine at the following points:

#### Combat System Integration
- **Enemy defeats**: `RecordEnemyKill(wasPerfect bool)` called when enemy dies
- **Boss defeats**: `RecordBossKill(timeTaken int64, wasPerfect bool)` called for boss kills
- **Damage tracking**: `RecordDamage(dealt int, taken int)` called on combat events
- **Combo tracking**: `RecordCombo(comboCount int)` called on consecutive kills

#### Exploration Integration
- **Room visits**: `RecordRoomVisit(isPerfect bool)` called when entering new room
- First-time visits are tracked to prevent duplicate counting
- Perfect room status tracked (no damage taken in room)

#### Collection Integration
- **Items**: `RecordItemCollected()` called when picking up items
- **Abilities**: `RecordAbilityUnlocked()` called when unlocking new abilities
- Key items grant abilities which trigger achievement tracking

#### Player Death
- **Deaths**: `RecordDeath()` called when player health reaches 0
- Affects challenge achievements like "Survivor"

### Progress Tracking

Achievements track real-time progress:

```go
type AchievementProgress struct {
    AchievementID   AchievementID
    CurrentValue    int
    TargetValue     int
    Progress        float64  // 0.0 to 1.0
    LastUpdated     time.Time
}
```

Players can see their progress toward achievements at any time.

### Persistence

Achievements are automatically saved with game progress:

#### Save Integration
- Achievement statistics stored in `SaveData.AchievementStats`
- Backward compatible (optional field)
- Statistics restored on game load
- Separate achievement persistence file for global unlocks

#### Files
- **Game saves**: `~/.vania/saves/save_N.json` - Contains achievement stats per save
- **Global achievements**: `~/.vania/achievements/achievements.json` - Global unlock history

### Unlock Notifications

When an achievement is unlocked:

```go
achievementTracker.SetOnUnlock(func(ach *achievement.Achievement) {
    println("🏆 Achievement Unlocked:", ach.Name, "-", ach.Description)
})
```

Currently displays console notifications. Can be extended to show in-game UI notifications.

## Usage

### For Players

Achievements automatically track as you play:

1. **View Progress**: Play the game to see achievement notifications
2. **Check Statistics**: After game ends, see achievement summary
3. **Completion**: Track overall completion percentage and points earned

### For Developers

#### Registering Custom Achievements

```go
customAchievement := &achievement.Achievement{
    ID:          "my_achievement",
    Name:        "My Achievement",
    Description: "Do something awesome",
    Category:    achievement.CategoryCombat,
    Rarity:      achievement.RarityRare,
    Points:      50,
    RequiresKills: 25,
}

tracker.RegisterAchievement(customAchievement)
```

#### Tracking Custom Events

```go
// Record a custom event
tracker.RecordEnemyKill(true)  // Perfect kill
tracker.RecordItemCollected()
tracker.RecordCombo(15)        // 15-hit combo

// Or update statistics directly
stats := tracker.GetStatistics()
stats.SecretsFound++
tracker.UpdateStatistics(stats)
```

#### Special Requirements

For achievements with custom logic:

```go
// Add to checkSpecialRequirement in achievement.go
case "my_special_condition":
    return at.stats.CustomStat >= 100
```

## Testing

The achievement system has comprehensive test coverage:

### Unit Tests (32 tests)

```bash
go test ./internal/achievement -v
```

Tests cover:
- Achievement registration and retrieval
- Progress tracking and updates
- Unlock conditions and callbacks
- Statistics recording
- Persistence (save/load)
- Edge cases and error handling

## Performance

The achievement system is designed for minimal overhead:

- **Memory**: ~50KB for tracker and all achievements
- **CPU**: O(1) for most operations (map lookups)
- **Checking**: O(n) where n = number of achievements (typically < 100ms)
- **Persistence**: Async save operations don't block gameplay

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the system:

### Planned Features
- [ ] In-game UI for achievement viewing
- [ ] Achievement notification popups
- [ ] Steam/platform integration
- [ ] Leaderboards for speedrun achievements
- [ ] Achievement-based rewards (cosmetics, etc.)
- [ ] Cross-save achievement syncing
- [ ] Achievement statistics dashboard
- [ ] Rare achievement showcase

### Additional Achievement Ideas
- Biome-specific achievements (visit all rooms in a biome)
- Weapon mastery achievements
- No-upgrade completion
- Specific boss tactics (defeat boss with specific strategy)
- Sequence breaking achievements
- Speedrun splits (defeat first boss in < 5 minutes)
