# Advanced Enemy AI System

## Overview

The Advanced Enemy AI System extends VANIA's enemy behavior with learning capabilities, coordinated group tactics, and adaptive difficulty. This system enables enemies to remember player patterns, coordinate attacks with nearby allies, and dynamically adjust their strategies based on combat outcomes.

### Key Structures

#### AIMemory
Tracks player behavior patterns and learns from combat interactions.

```go
type AIMemory struct {
    // Movement tracking
    LastPlayerPositions []Position    // Ring buffer of recent positions
    PlayerVelocityAvg   float64       // Average player speed
    JumpFrequency       float64       // How often player jumps
    AttackFrequency     float64       // How often player attacks
    DashFrequency       float64       // How often player dashes
    
    // Combat statistics
    DamageReceived      int           // Total damage taken
    AttacksEvaded       int           // Player attacks dodged
    SuccessfulHits      int           // Hits landed on player
    
    // Learned behaviors
    PreferredAttackDistance float64   // Optimal attack range
    RetreatThreshold        float64   // Health % to retreat at
    
    // Adaptive difficulty
    PlayerSkillEstimate float64       // 0.0-1.0 skill level
    ConfidenceLevel     float64       // 0.0-1.0 prediction confidence
    LearningRate        float64       // Adaptation speed
}
```

#### EnemyGroup
Manages coordinated behavior between multiple enemies.

```go
type EnemyGroup struct {
    Members            []*EnemyInstance
    Leader             *EnemyInstance
    Formation          FormationType
    TargetX, TargetY   float64
    GroupState         GroupState
    CommunicationRange float64
}
```

#### Formation Types

1. **NoFormation** - Individual behavior
2. **LineFormation** - Defensive horizontal line
3. **CircleFormation** - Surround player
4. **PincerFormation** - Attack from two sides
5. **VFormation** - Leader in front, others flanking
6. **ScatteredFormation** - Spread out to avoid AoE

#### Tactical States

- **TacticalNormal** - Standard behavior
- **TacticalAggressive** - Push advantage when winning
- **TacticalDefensive** - Protect self when losing
- **TacticalFlanking** - Try to get behind player
- **TacticalKiting** - Hit and run tactics
- **TacticalRetreating** - Fallback to safety
- **TacticalRegrouping** - Wait for allies

## Features

### 1. Learning & Memory

#### Pattern Recognition
Enemies track player movements and actions:
- **Position History**: Last 20 player positions stored
- **Movement Analysis**: Calculates average velocity and direction
- **Action Tracking**: Monitors jump, attack, and dash frequency
- **Skill Estimation**: Evaluates player skill (0.0-1.0) based on performance

#### Combat Learning
Enemies adapt based on combat outcomes:
- **Preferred Distance**: Learns optimal attack range from successful hits
- **Retreat Behavior**: Adjusts retreat threshold based on damage taken
- **Confidence Building**: Increases prediction confidence over time
- **Evasion Tracking**: Counts successfully dodged attacks

#### Example Usage
```go
// Update memory with player observations
enemy.Memory.UpdateMemory(playerX, playerY, didJump, didAttack, didDash)

// Record combat event
enemy.RecordSuccessfulHit(distance)
enemy.TakeDamage(damage) // Automatically updates memory

// Use learned behavior
if enemy.Memory.ShouldRetreat(healthPercent) {
    // Enemy retreats based on learned threshold
}

// Predict player position
predX, predY := enemy.Memory.PredictPlayerPosition(deltaTime)
```

### 2. Coordinated Group Tactics

#### Group Formation
Enemies automatically form groups and coordinate:
- **Dynamic Leadership**: Strongest alive enemy becomes leader
- **Communication Range**: Enemies within 400 pixels can coordinate
- **Formation Selection**: Chooses formation based on group size and state
- **Position Assignment**: Each enemy gets formation position

#### Formation Behaviors

**Circle Formation** (4+ enemies engaging)
```
     E
  E  P  E    P = Player
     E       E = Enemy
```
Enemies surround player, attacking from all sides.

**Pincer Formation** (2-3 enemies engaging)
```
E        E
    P        P = Player
E        E   E = Enemy
```
Split group attacks from opposite sides.

**V Formation** (3+ enemies patrolling)
```
      L       L = Leader
    E E       E = Enemy
  E     E
```
Leader in front, others follow in V pattern.

**Line Formation** (regrouping/defensive)
```
E  E  E  E   E = Enemy
```
Enemies form defensive line.

#### Example Usage
```go
// Create and populate group
group := NewEnemyGroup()
group.AddMember(enemy1)
group.AddMember(enemy2)

// Update group coordination
group.UpdateGroup(playerX, playerY)

// Assign group to enemies
enemy1.Group = group
enemy2.Group = group

// Formation movement automatically applied in enemy Update()
```

### 3. Tactical Decision Making

#### State Selection
System automatically chooses tactical state based on:
- **Health Level**: Low health triggers retreat/regroup
- **Ally Count**: Presence of allies enables coordination
- **Combat Success**: Win/loss ratio affects aggression
- **Player Skill**: High skill triggers advanced tactics

#### Tactical Behaviors

**Aggressive** (winning fight, high health)
- Increased aggro range (+20%)
- More persistent chase behavior
- Shorter attack cooldowns

**Defensive** (taking heavy damage)
- Reduced aggro range (-20%)
- Increased attack range (+30%)
- More cautious approach

**Flanking** (skilled player, has room to maneuver)
- Attempts to circle around player
- Group coordination for pincer attacks
- Avoids direct confrontation

**Kiting** (good evasion record)
- Hit and run tactics
- Attack then immediately retreat
- Maintains preferred distance

**Retreating** (low health, solo)
- Moves away from player at high speed
- Prioritizes survival over damage
- Seeks safe distance

**Regrouping** (low health, has allies)
- Moves toward group center
- Waits for allies to engage
- Forms defensive formation

#### Example Integration
```go
// Tactical state automatically determined in Update()
func (ei *EnemyInstance) Update(playerX, playerY float64) {
    // Calculate tactical state based on memory
    healthPercent := float64(ei.CurrentHealth) / float64(ei.Enemy.Health)
    hasAllies := ei.Group != nil && len(ei.Group.Members) > 1
    ei.TacticalState = ei.Memory.GetTacticalState(healthPercent, hasAllies, distToPlayer)
    
    // Apply tactical modifications
    ei.applyTacticalBehavior(distToPlayer, dx, dy, playerX, playerY)
    
    // Normal behavior continues...
}
```

### 4. Adaptive Difficulty

#### Dynamic Adjustment
System adapts to player performance:
- **Skill Estimation**: Continuously updated based on actions
- **Threshold Tuning**: Retreat/aggro values adjust over time
- **Learning Rate**: Controls adaptation speed (default: 0.05)
- **Confidence Growth**: Predictions improve with experience

#### Difficulty Indicators
```go
// High skill player (0.7+)
- More attacks per second
- Effective dash usage
- High movement speed
→ Enemies use flanking and kiting tactics

// Average skill player (0.4-0.7)
- Moderate action frequency
- Some evasion
- Medium movement
→ Enemies use standard behaviors with some adaptation

// Low skill player (< 0.4)
- Fewer attacks
- Limited dash usage
- Lower movement speed
→ Enemies use aggressive tactics to press advantage
```

## Integration

### Existing Systems

#### With Base AI Behaviors
```go
// Advanced AI extends, doesn't replace base behaviors
switch ei.Enemy.Behavior {
case PatrolBehavior:
    ei.updatePatrolBehavior(distToPlayer, dx, dy)
    // Tactical state modifies patrol behavior
case ChaseBehavior:
    ei.updateChaseBehavior(distToPlayer, dx, dy)
    // Learning adjusts chase parameters
}
```

#### With Combat System
```go
// Combat events automatically update memory
func (ei *EnemyInstance) TakeDamage(damage int) {
    ei.CurrentHealth -= damage
    ei.Memory.RecordCombatEvent(false, true, damage, 0)
}

func (ei *EnemyInstance) RecordSuccessfulHit(distance float64) {
    ei.Memory.RecordCombatEvent(true, false, 0, distance)
}
```

#### With Animation System
```go
// Animation state reflects tactical behavior
switch ei.State {
case AttackState:
    ei.AnimController.Play("attack", true)
case FleeState, ChaseState:
    ei.AnimController.Play("patrol", false)
}
```

### Room-Level Coordination
```go
// In game runner, manage enemy groups per room
func (gr *GameRunner) updateCurrentRoom() {
    // Create groups for nearby enemies
    for _, enemy := range gr.CurrentRoom.Enemies {
        allies := GetNearbyAllies(gr.CurrentRoom.Enemies, 
                                  enemy.X, enemy.Y, 400)
        if len(allies) > 0 {
            // Create or join group
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    // Update all groups
    for _, group := range roomGroups {
        group.UpdateGroup(playerX, playerY)
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Memory Updates**: Only update when player is within aggro range
2. **Group Coordination**: Update groups every 100ms, not every frame
3. **Formation Calculation**: Only recalculate when group state changes
4. **Position History**: Ring buffer with 20 element limit
5. **Tactical Decisions**: Cached, not recalculated every frame

### Complexity Analysis
- **Memory Update**: O(1) - constant time operations
- **Group Coordination**: O(n) - where n is group size (typically 2-5)
- **Formation Application**: O(n) - linear with group size
- **Tactical State**: O(1) - simple threshold comparisons
- **Ally Detection**: O(m) - where m is enemies in room (typically 3-10)

**Overall**: O(n) per room update, very efficient for typical enemy counts.
