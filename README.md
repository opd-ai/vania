# VANIA - Procedural Metroidvania Game Engine

A fully procedurally-generated retro Metroidvania game written in pure Go, where **ALL assets** (graphics, audio, story, levels) are generated algorithmically at runtime.

## 🎮 Overview

VANIA is an advanced procedural content generation (PCG) project that eliminates traditional asset creation entirely. Instead of loading pre-made sprites, sounds, or story text, the game generates everything algorithmically at runtime:

- **Pixel art sprites** through algorithmic drawing
- **Sound effects and music** through waveform synthesis
- **Narrative elements** (dialogue, lore, quests, character backstories) through procedural story generation
- **World layouts and progression** through algorithmic level design

No pre-rendered images, bundled audio files, or static narrative content are permitted in the project. All output is deterministic: identical seeds produce identical results.

Each game is generated from a single seed value, providing infinite unique, playable experiences.

## ✨ Features

### Procedural Graphics Generation
- Sprite generation using cellular automata and symmetry
- Multiple color schemes (complementary, triadic, analogous, monochromatic)
- Tileset generation with biome-specific themes
- Automatic palette generation based on HSV color theory
- Outline and shading effects for visual clarity

### Procedural Audio Synthesis
- Waveform generators (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, noise)
- ADSR envelope system for realistic sound shaping
- Sound effect generation (jump, attack, hit, pickup, etc.)
- Music composition with chord progressions and multiple layers
- Biome-specific music with appropriate mood and scale

### Procedural Narrative Generation
- Story themes (fantasy, sci-fi, horror, mystical, post-apocalyptic)
- Character and faction generation
- Item and room descriptions
- World lore and player motivations
- Dynamic narrative elements tied to gameplay

### Advanced World Generation
- Graph-based world structure ensuring playability
- 80-150 procedurally generated rooms per world
- 4-6 distinct biomes with unique characteristics
- Ability-gated progression (Metroidvania-style)
- Critical path generation with side branches
- Backtracking shortcuts

### Entity & Combat Generation
- Procedural enemy generation scaled to danger level
- Boss fights with multiple phases
- Behavior patterns (patrol, chase, flee, flying, etc.)
- Attack types (melee, ranged, area, contact damage)
- Ability progression system
- Item generation (weapons, consumables, key items, upgrades)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opd-ai/vania.git
cd vania

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the game
go build -o vania ./cmd/game
```

### Running the Game

```bash
# Generate a random game (uses current timestamp as seed)
./vania

# Generate a specific game from a seed
./vania --seed 42

# Play the game with rendering (NEW!)
./vania --seed 42 --play

# Share seeds with friends to play the same generated game!
./vania --seed 1337 --play
```

**Note**: The `--play` flag launches the full game with rendering, physics, controls, enemies, and combat. See [docs/RENDERING.md](docs/RENDERING.md) for detailed setup instructions and [docs/systems/COMBAT_SYSTEM.md](docs/systems/COMBAT_SYSTEM.md) for combat mechanics.

## 🎯 Key Technical Achievements

### Zero External Assets
- **No pre-rendered, embedded, or bundled asset files of any kind** — no `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, `.gif`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`, no static dialogue, no pre-written story scripts, and no fixed narrative text
- 100% of gameplay assets — audio, visual, and narrative/story-driven components — are procedurally generated at runtime using deterministic algorithms
- Reproducible: same seed = same game, identical output given identical inputs

### Deterministic Generation
- Single master seed derives all subsystem seeds
- Hash-based seed derivation for independent subsystems
- Consistent output across runs and platforms

### Quality Assurance
- Generation validation ensures playability
- Visual coherence scoring
- Audio harmony validation
- Narrative consistency verification

### Performance
- Generation completes in ~0.3 seconds
- Efficient caching system
- Optimized for low memory usage
