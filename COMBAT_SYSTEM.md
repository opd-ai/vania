# Enemy AI and Combat System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the enemy AI and combat system implementation added to the VANIA procedural Metroidvania game engine. These systems bring enemies to life with intelligent behavior patterns and create engaging combat gameplay.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enemy AI System (`internal/entity/ai.go`)

The AI system provides runtime enemy behavior with the following capabilities:

#### Enemy Instance Management
- **EnemyInstance**: Runtime representation of enemies with position, velocity, health, and state
- Converts procedurally generated enemy definitions into interactive game entities
- Maintains patrol boundaries, aggro ranges, and attack cooldowns

#### Behavior Patterns

**Patrol Behavior**
- Enemies move back and forth within defined boundaries
- Detects player within aggro range and transitions to chase
- Returns to patrol when player leaves range

**Chase Behavior**
- Actively pursues the player when in range
- Moves horizontally toward player position
- Transitions to attack state when in melee range

**Flee Behavior**
- Moves away from the player when too close
- Useful for ranged enemies or support characters
- Returns to idle when safe distance achieved

**Stationary Behavior**
- Remains in place (turrets, statues)
- Attacks when player enters range
- Does not move or chase

**Flying Behavior**
- Moves in both X and Y axes
- Hovers and patrols vertically
- Pursues player through air when in range

**Jumping Behavior**
- Ground-based movement with periodic jumps
- Jumps toward player when in chase range
- Creates unpredictable movement patterns

#### State Machine
- **IdleState**: Neutral, minimal movement
- **PatrolState**: Following patrol path
- **ChaseState**: Pursuing player
- **AttackState**: Executing attack animation
- **FleeState**: Moving away from player
- **DeadState**: Enemy defeated

### 2. Combat System (`internal/engine/combat.go`)

The combat system manages all damage and attack interactions:

#### Player Combat
- **Attack Initiation**: Press J to attack
- **Attack Duration**: 15 frames (0.25 seconds at 60 FPS)
- **Attack Cooldown**: 20 frames between attacks
- **Attack Hitbox**: 40x32 pixel area in front of player
- **Active Frames**: Hitbox active frames 3-10 of attack animation

#### Damage Mechanics
- **Player Damage**: Configurable base damage (default: 10)
- **Enemy Damage**: Varies by enemy type and danger level
- **Health Tracking**: Both player and enemies have current/max health
- **Death Detection**: Entities removed when health reaches 0

#### Knockback System
- **Enemy Knockback**: Pushed back 5 pixels horizontally, 3 pixels up
- **Player Knockback**: Pushed back 8 pixels horizontally, 5 pixels up
- **Decay**: Knockback velocity decays by 80% per frame
- **Direction**: Knockback direction based on relative positions

#### Invulnerability
- **Duration**: 60 frames (1 second) after taking damage
- **Protection**: No additional damage during invulnerability
- **Visual Feedback**: Player can implement flashing or transparency

#### Collision Detection
- **AABB Collision**: Axis-Aligned Bounding Box detection
- **Attack vs Enemy**: Checks if attack hitbox overlaps enemy bounds
- **Player vs Enemy**: Checks if player and enemy bodies overlap
- **Platform Collision**: Enemies respect platform boundaries

### 3. Enemy Rendering (`internal/render/renderer.go`)

#### Enemy Visualization
- **Size-Based Sprites**: Enemies rendered at appropriate sizes
  - Small: 16x16 pixels
  - Medium: 32x32 pixels
  - Large: 64x64 pixels
  - Boss: 128x128 pixels
- **Color Coding**: Red sprites for enemies
- **Health Bars**: Green health bar displayed above each enemy
- **Camera Culling**: Off-screen enemies not rendered for performance

#### Attack Effects
- **Visual Feedback**: Semi-transparent yellow hitbox during attacks
- **Timing**: Only visible during active attack frames
- **Position**: Follows player facing direction

### 4. Game Integration (`internal/engine/runner.go`)

#### Enemy Spawning
- 3-5 enemies spawn per combat room
- Enemies positioned across room width
- Uses procedurally generated enemy definitions

#### Update Loop Integration
- Enemy AI updates each frame
- Physics applied to enemies (gravity, velocity)
- Platform collision resolution
- Combat detection and resolution
- Camera follows player

#### Debug Information
- Enemy count (alive/total) displayed
- Player health shown
- Invulnerability status indicated
- FPS and position tracking

## Usage

### Playing with Combat

```bash
# Build the game
go build -o vania ./cmd/game

# Run with rendering and combat
./vania --seed 42 --play
```

### Controls
- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move
- **Space**: Jump
- **J**: Attack
- **K**: Dash (when unlocked)
- **P / Escape**: Pause
- **Ctrl+Q**: Quit

### Combat Tips
1. Attack has cooldown - time your strikes
2. Use invulnerability frames after taking damage to reposition
3. Different enemies have different behaviors - learn their patterns
4. Knockback can be used to create distance
5. Flying enemies require different tactics than ground enemies

## Technical Details

### Performance
- **Enemy AI**: O(1) per enemy per frame
- **Collision Detection**: O(n*m) where n=enemies, m=platforms
- **Combat Checks**: O(n) where n=enemies
- **Typical Load**: 3-5 enemies = ~60 FPS on modern hardware

### Memory Usage
- Enemy Instance: ~120 bytes
- Combat System: ~32 bytes
- Negligible overhead per enemy

### Extensibility
- Add new behavior patterns by implementing Update methods
- Extend combat with projectiles, area attacks, combos
- Add status effects (poison, stun, freeze)
- Implement advanced AI (predictive, tactical)

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **AI Tests**: 12 tests covering all behavior patterns
- **Combat Tests**: 13 tests covering all combat mechanics
- **Integration**: Validated through gameplay

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test AI system
go test ./internal/entity -v

# Test combat system (requires no X11)
cd internal/engine && go test combat_test.go combat.go game.go -v

# Test all non-graphical systems
go test ./internal/pcg ./internal/physics ./internal/entity -v
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Basic AI**: Current AI is functional but not advanced
   - No pathfinding around obstacles
   - Simple line-of-sight detection
   - No tactical group behavior

2. **Combat Simplicity**: 
   - Single attack type for player
   - No combos or special moves
   - Basic knockback physics

3. **Visual Effects**:
   - Simple colored rectangles for sprites
   - No particle effects
   - Minimal animation

4. **Performance**:
   - Large enemy counts (>20) may impact FPS
   - No spatial partitioning optimization

## Future Enhancements

   - Group tactics
   - Learning player patterns

2. **Enhanced Combat**

   - Particle effects
   - Screen shake on hits
   - Blood/impact effects

4. **Boss Battles**
   - Multi-phase boss fights
   - Unique attack patterns
   - Arena hazards

5. **Difficulty Scaling**
   - Enemy stats scale with progress
   - Elite/champion variants
   - Difficulty settings
